      About Derek Del Rio Jr.
    </h3>
    
    <p>
      After failing to complete my courses in college, I decided to pursue a career in software       development. I have always been interested in technology and how it works, and I have           always been fascinated by the idea of creating something that can help people. Beginning        my journey in software development, I'm hoping it will help me to develop my skills and         create something that can bring a smile to people's faces.
    </p>

    <p>
      One major aspect of my life outside of software development is my love for video games. I       have been playing video games since I was a kid and have always been fascinated by the          world of gaming. I have always been a fan of games that are fun and challenging, and I am       always looking for new games to enjoy with friends. Hopefully these skills I have learned       here at Thinkful will help me to create a game that is fun and enjoyable for everyone.
